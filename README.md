This code is based off of an existing project completed by Aleksander Haber. It executes the training of a .keras file saved neural net trained in the Cartpole-V1 environment from openAI Gymnasium. The simulate_model class also creates a human render window that shows a comparison of the model with the same environment and wholly random actions.
